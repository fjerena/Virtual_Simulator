# Virtual_Simulator
Virtual simulator

This software was created to validate my CDI in ideal condition planning to create a rig that I can perform different tests without generate a lot of noise and 
demand less space for the hardware...
I created a big table with 40 lines that is defined the engine speed in each line, this table variates by 500rpm between lines and is changed after 50 cycles 
(in the same engine speed).
The idea is improve this software accordling my needs during the validation proccess of my CDI.
This application is a alternative to not use my real simulator, but probably for the real validation isn't ideal, this is a complementary test...
